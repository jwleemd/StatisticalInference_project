##Overview

In this document, the properties of sample means for random samples obtained from an exponential distribution are analyzed.

##Simulations
The following R code simulates sampling of 1000 sets of 40 exponentials. The rate parameter, lambda, is set to 0.2.  

```{r}
lambda = 0.2   # rate for the exponential distribution
nosim=1000     # number of simulations
n = 40         # size of a sample
samples = replicate(nosim, mean(rexp(n, rate=lambda)))  # a vector of 1000 sample means
```

##Sample mean versus Theoretical Mean

The mean and variance of the sample means are calculated. 

```{r, echo=TRUE}
mean(samples)  # average of the 1000 sample means
sd(samples)       # standard error: standard deviation of the sample means
```
The theoretical mean for the exponential distribution with rate = 0.2 is 1/0.2 = 5. The mean of 1000 samples means is approximately the same as the population mean. 

##Sample variance vs Theoretical variance
The variace for the exponential distribution with rate = 0.2 is (1/0.2)^2 = 25. The variance of 1000 sample means is approximately (population variance)/40. 

##The distribution of 1000 sample means is approximately normal.

The histogram for the sample means shows that they approximate a normal distribution with a mean of 1/lambda and standard deviation of (1/lambda)/(sqrt(n)).

```{r, echo=FALSE}
hist(samples)
xfit<-seq(min(samples),max(samples),length=40) 
yfit<-dnorm(xfit,mean=1/lambda,sd=sd(samples)) 
yfit<- yfit*diff(hist(samples)$mids[1:2])*length(samples) 
lines(xfit, yfit, col="black", lwd=2)
```




You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
